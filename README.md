### Introduction:
Giving application developers or supporting 3rd parties administrative access to servers is sometimes needed. With a few clicks, a file share is created, providing convenient way to transfer files from and to the server. Unfortunately, keeping the default permissions can lead in some unwanted results.
Recently, having malicious code which scans the network and encrypts everything that can be accessed may cause serious service outages.

To automatically find file-shares with weak permissions and fix them before they can be misused I authored a small Management Pack for SCOM 2012 R2 (and higher).
